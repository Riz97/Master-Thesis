You wrote the following  sentence : find the gameobject called "Model_1",Model_2 and Model_3 and  destroy them and  substitute them  with the gameobject called Model_1 , Model_2 and Model_3 respectively  positioned in the folder named Furniture inside Resources ,at Y position equals to -0.47, at X position -2.38 and Z position 29.46 and do the same for Model_2 at X 0 and Model_3 at X 3, and add a collider for every model, find the gameobject named Model_4 and change its material with the material called Material inside the Furniture folderâ€‹

The script generated by the AI is the following 

using UnityEngine;

public class ModelChange : MonoBehaviour
{
    public GameObject Model_1;
    public GameObject Model_2;
    public GameObject Model_3;
    public GameObject Model_4;

    void Start()
    {
        // Destroy the old models
        Destroy(Model_1);
        Destroy(Model_2);
        Destroy(Model_3);

        // Create the new models
        Model_1 = Instantiate(Resources.Load("Furniture/Model_1"), new Vector3(-2.38f, -0.47f, 29.46f), Quaternion.identity) as GameObject;
        Model_2 = Instantiate(Resources.Load("Furniture/Model_2"), new Vector3(0f, -0.47f, 29.46f), Quaternion.identity) as GameObject;
        Model_3 = Instantiate(Resources.Load("Furniture/Model_3"), new Vector3(3f, -0.47f, 29.46f), Quaternion.identity) as GameObject;

        // Add a collider to each model
        Model_1.AddComponent<BoxCollider>();
        Model_2.AddComponent<BoxCollider>();
        Model_3.AddComponent<BoxCollider>();

        // Change the material of Model_4
        Renderer renderer = Model_4.GetComponent<Renderer>();
        renderer.material = Resources.Load("Furniture/Material", typeof(Material)) as Material;
