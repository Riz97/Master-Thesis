You wrote the following  sentence : 1)	Find the gameobject called Model_1,Model_2 and Model_3
2)	Destroy them
3)	Substitute them
4)	Load the model respectively positioned inside the folder named Furniture inside Resources
5)	,at Y position equals to -0.47, at X position -2.38 and Z position 29.46 and do the same for Model_2 at X 0 and Model_3 at X 3
6)	Add just one collider per gameobject
7)	Find the gamobject named Model_4
8)	Change its materials with the material called Material inside the Furniture Folder
9)	Use a method called Start
