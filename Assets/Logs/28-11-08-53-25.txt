You wrote the following  sentence : find the gameobject called "Model_1" destroy it and  substitute the object with the gameobject
 called Model_1 in the folder named Models ,at Y position equals to -0.47, at X position -2.38 and Z position 29.46 and do the same for Model_2 at X 0 and Model_3 at X 3
​

The script generated by the AI is the following 

using UnityEngine;

public class DestroyAndSubstitute : MonoBehaviour 
{
	void Start() 
	{
		// Find the gameobject called "Model_1" and destroy it.
		GameObject model1 = GameObject.Find("Model_1");
		Destroy(model1);

		// Substitute the destroyed object with the gameobject called Model_1 in the folder named Models.
		GameObject newModel1 = Resources.Load("Models/Model_1") as GameObject;
		Instantiate(newModel1, new Vector3(-2.38f, -0.47f, 29.46f), Quaternion.identity);

		// Find the gameobject called "Model_2" and destroy it.
		GameObject model2 = GameObject.Find("Model_2");
		Destroy(model2);
