You wrote the following  sentence : find the gameobject called "Model_1" destroy it and  substitute the object with the gameobject
 called Model_1 in the folder named Models ,at Y position equals to -0.47, at X position -2.38 and Z position 29.46 and do the same for Model_2 at X 0 and Model_3 at X 3
​

The script generated by the AI is the following 

using UnityEngine;

public class DestroyAndSubstitute : MonoBehaviour {
    public GameObject Model_1;
    public GameObject Model_2;
    public GameObject Model_3;
    
    void Start()
    {
        Destroy(GameObject.Find("Model_1"));
        Model_1 = (GameObject)Instantiate(Resources.Load("Models/Model_1"), new Vector3(-2.38f, -0.47f, 29.46f), Quaternion.identity);
        Model_2 = (GameObject)Instantiate(Resources.Load("Models/Model_2"), new Vector3(0f, 0f, 0f), Quaternion.identity);
