You wrote the following  sentence : the first thing to do is finding the gameobject called Model_1,Model_2 and Model_3 and  destroy them and  substitute them  with the gameobject called Model_1 , Model_2 and Model_3 respectively , remember that they are  positioned inside the folder named Furniture inside Resources ,at Y position equals to -0.47, at X position -2.38 and Z position 29.46 and do the same for Model_2 at X 0 and Model_3 at X 3, and add just one collider per gameobject, find the gameobject named Model_4 and change its material with the material called Material inside the Furniture folder, using a method called Start â€‹

The script generated by the AI is the following 

using UnityEngine;
public class ChangeModel : MonoBehaviour {
  void Start(){
    //Find the gameobjects
    GameObject model1 = Resources.Load("Furniture/Model_1") as GameObject;
    GameObject model2 = Resources.Load("Furniture/Model_2") as GameObject;
    GameObject model3 = Resources.Load("Furniture/Model_3") as GameObject;
    GameObject model4 = GameObject.Find("Model_4");

    //Destroy the old models
    Destroy(GameObject.Find("Model_1"));
    Destroy(GameObject.Find("Model_2"));
    Destroy(GameObject.Find("Model_3"));

    //Create new models
    GameObject newModel1 = Instantiate(model1, new Vector3(-2.38f, -0.47f, 29.46f), Quaternion.identity) as GameObject;
    GameObject newModel2 = Instantiate(model2, new Vector3(0f, -0.47f, 29.46f), Quaternion.identity) as GameObject;
    GameObject newModel3 = Instantiate(model3, new Vector3(3f, -0.47f, 29.46f), Quaternion.identity) as GameObject;

    //Rename the new models
    newModel1.name = "Model_1";
    newModel2.name = "Model_2";
    newModel3.name = "Model_3";

    //Add collider to the new models
    newModel1.AddComponent<BoxCollider>();
    newModel2.AddComponent<BoxCollider>();
    newModel3.AddComponent<BoxCollider>();

    //Change material of Model_4
    Material material = Resources.Load("Furniture/Material") as Material;
    model4.GetComponent<Renderer>().material = material;
  }
