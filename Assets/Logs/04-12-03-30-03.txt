You wrote the following  sentence : the first thing to do is finding the gameobject called "Model_1",Model_2 and Model_3 and  destroy them and  substitute them  with the gameobject called Model_1 , Model_2 and Model_3 respectively  positioned in the folder named Furniture inside Resources ,at Y position equals to -0.47, at X position -2.38 and Z position 29.46 and do the same for Model_2 at X 0 and Model_3 at X 3, and add just one collider per gameobject, find the gameobject named Model_4 and change its material with the material called Material inside the Furniture folder, using a method called Start ​
