You wrote the following  sentence : find the gameobject called "Model_1" destroy it and  substitute the object with the gameobject
 called Model_1 in the folder named Models ,at Y position equals to -0.47, at X position -2.38 and Z position 29.46 and do the same for Model_2 at X 0 and Model_3 at X 3

The script generated by the AI is the following 

using UnityEngine;

public class DestroyModel : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start()
    {
        //Find and destroy Model_1
        GameObject model1 = GameObject.Find("Model_1");
        Destroy(model1);

        //Instantiate Model_1 in Models folder at position (-2.38, -0.47, 29.46)
        GameObject model1Prefab = Resources.Load("Models/Model_1") as GameObject;
        Instantiate(model1Prefab, new Vector3(-2.38f, -0.47f, 29.46f), Quaternion.identity);

        //Find and destroy Model_2
        GameObject model2 = GameObject.Find("Model_2");
        Destroy(model2);

        //Instantiate Model_2 in Models folder at position (0, -0.47, 29.46)
