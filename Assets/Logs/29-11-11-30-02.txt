You wrote the following  sentence : find the gameobject called "Model_1" destroy it and  substitute the object with the gameobject
 called Model_1 in the folder named Furniture ,at Y position equals to -0.47, at X position -2.38 and Z position 29.46 and do the same for Model_2 at X 0 and Model_3 at X 3, and add a collider for every model, find the gameobject named Model_4 and change its material with the material called Material
