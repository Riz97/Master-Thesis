You wrote the following  sentence : find the gameobject called "Model_1",Model_2 and Model_3 and  destroy them and  substitute them  with the gameobject called Model_1 , Model_2 and Model_3 respectively  positioned in the folder named Furniture inside Resources ,at Y position equals to -0.47, at X position -2.38 and Z position 29.46 and do the same for Model_2 at X 0 and Model_3 at X 3, and add a collider for every model, find the gameobject named Model_4 and change its material with the material called Material inside the Furniture folder, using a method called Start and the name of the gameobjects in the hierarchy must be Model_1 , Model_2 and Model_3â€‹

The script generated by the AI is the following 

using UnityEngine;

public class ModelSubstitution : MonoBehaviour {

    public GameObject model_1;
    public GameObject model_2;
    public GameObject model_3;
    public GameObject model_4;

    void Start()
    {
        //Destroy the gameobjects with the names Model_1, Model_2 and Model_3 in the hierarchy
        Destroy(GameObject.Find("Model_1"));
        Destroy(GameObject.Find("Model_2"));
        Destroy(GameObject.Find("Model_3"));

        //Instantiate the new models from the Resources folder
        model_1 = (GameObject)Resources.Load("Furniture/Model_1");
        model_2 = (GameObject)Resources.Load("Furniture/Model_2");
        model_3 = (GameObject)Resources.Load("Furniture/Model_3");

        //Position the models at their respective positions
        Instantiate(model_1, new Vector3(-2.38f, -0.47f, 29.46f), Quaternion.identity);
        Instantiate(model_2, new Vector3(0f, -0.47f, 29.46f), Quaternion.identity);
        Instantiate(model_3, new Vector3(3f, -0.47f, 29.46f), Quaternion.identity);

        //Add a collider to each model
        model_1.AddComponent<BoxCollider>();
        model_2.AddComponent<BoxCollider>();
        model_3.AddComponent<BoxCollider>();

        //Find Model_4 and change its material with the material in the Resources folder
        model_4 = GameObject.Find("Model_4");
        model_4.GetComponent<Renderer>().material = (Material)Resources.Load("Furniture/Material");
    }
