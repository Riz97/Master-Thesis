You wrote the following  sentence : find the gameobjects called "Model_1","Model_2" and "Model_3", and change them into the models inside the folder named "Models"​

The script generated by the AI is the following 

using UnityEngine;

public class ChangeModel : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Start is called before the first frame update
    void Start()
    {
        //Find the gameobjects called Model_1, Model_2, and Model_3
        GameObject model1 = GameObject.Find("Model_1");
        GameObject model2 = GameObject.Find("Model_2");
        GameObject model3 = GameObject.Find("Model_3");

        //Change them into the models inside the folder named "Models"
        model1.GetComponent<MeshFilter>().mesh = Resources.Load<Mesh>("Models/Model_1");
        model2.GetComponent<MeshFilter>().mesh = Resources.Load<Mesh>("Models/Model_2");
        model3.GetComponent<MeshFilter>().mesh = Resources.Load<Mesh>("Models/Model_3");
    }
